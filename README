BUILDING

The sources come with Makefiles built using the Netbeans IDE on a
Windows platform. The steps for building mohs are as follows:

1. Download the Netbeans IDE with support for C/C++
2. Right-click on the project and choose ``Build''

Note: If you are under a non-Windows platform, right-click on the
project and click on ``Properties''. Select the ``Build'' item from
the left pane and change the ``Build Host'' to localhost.

RUNNING

The program requires the following parameters in order to run:

<hsConfigFile> configuration file to set various parameters to the
algorithm. Refer to the sample configuration file bundled with the sources.

<problem> The problem to solve, you may choose from one of: zdt1,
zdt2, zdt3, zdt4, zdt5, zdt6, cec09unprob1, cec09unprob2,
cec09unprob3, cec09unprob4, cec09unprob5.

<algorithm> variants of the HS algorithm: hs1, hs2, hs3. Notice that
hs2 corresponds to MOHS1 and hs3 corresponds to MOHS2 as described in
the paper cited above.

<calculateMetrics> pass 1 to calculate M* metrics, 0 otherwise.

<doSampling> pass 1 to calculate sampling data, 0 otherwise.

<modalMode> pass 1 to run the HS algorithm with mode, 0 otherwise.
